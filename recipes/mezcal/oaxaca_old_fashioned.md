description: |-
  This cocktail -- named for the Mexican state from where most mezcals hail --
  helped kick off the mezcal craze in the United States and is a riff on the
  classic whiskey Old Fashioned. The original version mixes lightly aged reposado
  tequila and mezcal, but I prefer to go all in and amp it up with the ancient
  aphrodisiac Damiana.

ingredients:
  - 2 ounces mezcal
  - 1 ounce Damiana liquor
  - 2 dashes Angostura bitters

Stir with ice in a rocks glass until well chilled. Flame an orange peel over the
top of the drink to express its oils, then garnish with it.
