  An earthy twist on a classic cocktail, this Mezcal Negroni recipe will surprise
  your tastebuds in the best way. Made with only three ingredients, this simple,
  refreshing cocktail will become a staple in your bar creations.

  My version tones down the bitterness with Aperol taking the place of Campari.
ingredients:
  - 1 ½ oz Mezcal
  - 1 ½ oz Sweet vermouth
  - 1 ½ oz Aperol

Stir together. Carefully twist and pinch the orange peel over the glass
to release a small amount of oil.
