  This simple and refreshing grapefruit highball is beloved for a reason. When
  you're looking for a refreshing cocktail that will hit all the right notes in
  less than two shakes, the Paloma's three-ingredient highball built directly
  in the glass is a sure thing.

  When making with mezcal, choose one that is light and less smoky to keep that
  clean and crisp flavor.

ingredients:
  - 2 ounces tequila or mezcal
  - Â½ ounce lime juice
  - Grapefruit soda, chilled, to top
