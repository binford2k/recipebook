  This take on the devilish classic simply swaps in mezcal for the traditional
  tequila. Topped with crème de cassis (a sweet blackcurrant liqueur), this will
  tingle your taste buds.

ingredients:
  - 1 ½ ounces mezcal
  - ½ ounce homemade crème de cassis
  - ½ ounce lime juice
  - ginger beer

---
Add ice to your glass. Stir together the lime and mezcal. Carefully top with
ginger beer and then finally float the crème de cassis. Garnish with a lime wheel.
