description: |-
  Earthy tequila, spicy jalapeño and fresh watermelon come together for this
  perfect summer cocktail. It's fragrant, bright red and laced with electrolytes.
  Make in case of hot weather.

  Watermelon is underutilized in cocktails, and it’s easy to see why. Use too
  little, and the flavor is lost. Use too much, and you can dilute your drink. But
  when the combination of spirit and watermelon balanced with citrus and sweetener
  come together accurately, it hits a stellar note and goes down in a hurry.

ingredients:
  - 1 slice jalapeño
  - 3 scoops of watermelon
  - 2 ounces tequila or mezcal
  - ¾ ounce lime juice
  - ¾ ounce agave syrup

Muddle and stir. Strain out the pulp, if you like.
