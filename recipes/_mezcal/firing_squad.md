  A suitably interesting alternative to a Margarita. A few hefty dashes of bitters
  add depth and warm baking-spice notes to the drink. Some modern-day iterations
  call for it to be topped with club soda, but the classic is plenty refreshing
  without it—a fine replacement for your usual Margarita.

ingredients:
  - 2 ounces Mezcal
  - ¾ ounce lime juice
  - ¾ ounce grenadine
  - 4 dashes Angostura bitters

Shake until chilled, then strain into a rocks glass. Garnish with a lime wheel.
