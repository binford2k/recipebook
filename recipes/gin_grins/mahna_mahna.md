  So why's it called Mah Nà Mah Nà? No one knows. But the song that's probably in
  your head right now was written for the soundtrack of a 60's film about wild
  sexual activity, lesbian nightclubs, and swinging in Sweden. The song, while not
  exactly being sexy at all, accompanied a sultry sauna scene which gave its
  original title "Viva la Sauna Svedese" ("Hooray for the Swedish Sauna").

  I don't know how you get from there to this cocktail, but there you have it.

ingredients:
  - 1 oz Gin, Aviation
  - 3/4 oz Aquavit, Krogstad
  - 1/2 oz Herbal liqueur, Strega
  - 1/2 oz Lemon juice
  - 1 twist Lemon peel (as garnish)

Add the liquids into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.
Strain into a cocktail glass and garnish with a lemon twist.
