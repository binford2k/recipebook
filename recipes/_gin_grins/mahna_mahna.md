  So why's it called Mah Nà Mah Nà? No one knows. But the song that's probably in
  your head right now was originally written for the soundtrack of a 60's film
  about wild sexual activity, lesbian nightclubs, and swinging in Sweden. The
  song, while not exactly being sexy at all, accompanied a suggestive sauna scene
  which gave it its original title "Viva la Sauna Svedese" ("Hooray for the
  Swedish Sauna"). The Muppets came later.

  I don't know how you get from there to this cocktail, but there you have it.

ingredients:
  - 1 part Gin
  - 3/4 part Aquavit
  - 1/2 part Strega
  - 1/2 part Lemon juice
  - Lemon twist as garnish

Add the liquids into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.
Strain into a cocktail glass and garnish with a lemon twist.
