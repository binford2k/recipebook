image:  /images/Ford-Cocktail.jpg
description: |-
  Whitechapel is a swank pub in the San Francisco Embassy hotel. This cocktail
  combines the light sweetness of an Old Tom gin with blanc vermouth and a splash
  of Bénédictine for a cocktail that drinks like a Martini, but with more
  complexity and crucially, fewer preconceptions and less pretensious.

ingredients:
  - 1 1/2 part Old Tom gin
  - 1 part blanc vermouth
  - 1/4 part Bénédictine
  - 2 dashes orange bitters

---
Combine all ingredients in a mixing glass and stir with ice. Strain into a
chilled cocktail glass. Express an orange peel over the drink and discard.
