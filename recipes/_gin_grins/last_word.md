  The Last Word was created just before the start of Prohibition, around 1915.
  After decades of being lost to history, it was rediscovered and its heady
  balance of sweet, sour and herbal flavors made it one of the first
  pre-Prohibition drinks to lead the cocktail revival of the noughties.

  Noughties is just a silly fun word that means the first decade of a century.
  Say it with me, _the noooouuuuughties_.

  In any case, I hope The Last Word will leave you, um, speechless.
