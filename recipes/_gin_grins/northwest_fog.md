  London is famous for its foggy weather. The geography of the city is like a
  basin, so when moisture rises from the river running through, it's trapped and
  settles in. Then as the Industrial Revolution filled the air with pollutants,
  the fog grew dark and dank and eventually became the toxic pea soup of legends.

  There are several takes on a London Fog cocktail, from a blended Scotch concoction
  to a smoky absinthe masterpiece. This one simply riffs on the Earl Grey tea
  drink, and brings it home to the good old PNW for a local twist. We first had
  this cocktail at the Hi-Top tavern around the way.

ingredients:
  - 2 part Aria gin
  - 1 part Earl Grey simple syrup
  - a splash of Bénédictine
  - Lemon slice as garnish

Stir with ice in a rocks glass until well chilled. Garnish with a lemon slice,
squeeze juice to taste.
