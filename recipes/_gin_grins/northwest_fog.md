  A local twist on the classic recipe. See, we like our gin around here. Our
  fog has a bit of warm, citrusy flavor to it.

ingredients:
  - 2 oz Aria gin
  - 1 oz Earl Grey simple syrup
  - a splash of Bénédictine
  - Lemon slice as garnish

Stir with ice in a rocks glass until well chilled. Garnish with a lemon slice,
squeeze juice to taste.
