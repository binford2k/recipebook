  The Negroni is said to have been invented in Florence by the dashing Italian
  adventurer Count Camillo Negroni who decided that his favorite cocktail, the
  Americano, just wasn't strong enough. Replacing the usual soda water with gin
  was just the thing to put hair on your chest or whatever it was that manly men
  were after.

  That fateful substitution resulted in one of the most popular stirred drinks in
  history, and its simple ratios has made a platform for thousands of riffs. For
  example, if you substituted bourbon for the gin you'd get a Boulevardier and
  using dark rum gets you a Kingston.

  My preference is a less bitter cocktail, so mine is the more controversial take
  of replacing the Campari with Aperol. You can try it either way!


ingredients:
  - 1 part gin
  - 1 part Campari (or Aperol)
  - 1 part sweet vermouth
  - Orange twist as garnish
