  Did you know that Kissinger once said _"Covert action should not be confused
  with missionary work"_ after leading hundreds of thousands of Kurds to their
  deaths in order to destabilize the Middle East? Or that he facilitated the
  Cambodian genocide, African civil wars, coups and death squads in Latin America?
  He's directly responsible for more than three million deaths, which definitely
  puts him in the villain category. He finally did something to make the world a
  better place and died in 2023.

  Anyways, totally totally unrelated, but this cocktail is real tasty.

ingredients:
  - 1.5 oz dry gin
  - 3/4 oz Strega
  - 1/4 oz Grenadine
  - 3 dashes of orange bitters
  - 1+ oz Champagne

Shake all parts except Champagne in ice until well chilled. Strain into Collins
glass and top with Champagne. It's a celebration, after all.
