  I don't recall who we were celebrating, but the cocktail is tasty.

ingredients:
  - 1.5 oz dry gin
  - 3/4 oz Strega
  - 1/4 oz Grenadine
  - 3 dashes of orange bitters
  - 1+ oz Champagne

---
Shake all parts except Champagne in ice until well chilled. Strain into Collins
glass and top with Champagne. It's a celebration, after all.
