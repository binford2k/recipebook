  The Feast of Saint Patrick (Lá Fhéile Pádraig), is held on 17 March and
  celebrates the heritage and culture of the Irish in general. It's perceived as
  the middle day of spring and people expected that weather would improve, so
  farmers would begin planting potato and other crops. It's celebrated with
  parades and merrymaking and wearing of green attire or shamrocks. Just as
  importantly, the Lenten restrictions on drinking alcohol were lifted for the day.

  So let's celebrate with a St Patrick's Day inspired cocktail combining
  London Dry Gin and single grain whiskey. It's strong and complex, just like
  your favorite Irelander.

ingredients:
  - 2 parts Ford's London Dry Gin
  - 2 parts Irish Whiskey
  - 1 part Sloe Gin
  - 1 part sweet vermouth
  - Dash of orange bitters

Combine all ingredients in a mixing glass and stir with ice. Strain into a
chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with a lime twist.
